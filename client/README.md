# MCApi.us Golang Client

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/andresperezl/mcapi/client?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/andresperezl/mcapi/client)

You may use this client to get the status of a server from [MCApi.us](https://mcapi.us).

There are two methods for the two functions the API provides, `GetServerStatus` and `GetServerQuery`.
It should be fairly easy to understand how to use either from the godoc.
